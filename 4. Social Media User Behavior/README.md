# About The Data

We will be working with a simulated data set related to social media sites. The data are stored in several files:

 - Profiles.csv: Information about the users with some fields from their profiles.

 - Connections.csv: Information about which users are connected to other users. *(Too large to upload)*

 - Registrations.csv: Information about history of the userâ€™s account registrations (logins) over time. *(Too large to upload)*

 - Header: The first row of the data set includes the column names, and each subsequent row includes one observation of values.
