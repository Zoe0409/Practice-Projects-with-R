### About The Data

We will be working with a simulated data set related to educational outcomes and technology. Students in an introductory Physics course were tracked throughout a semester long class. In addition to the lectures and textbook, the students also used a digital system to work practice problems. The system includes an algorithm that assesses the level of a student’s knowledge in the topic. It also measures the amount of minutes spent on the subject during the relevant period of time. Prior to the midterm exam, the students were expected to use the system and reach a level of 2 on a number of topics. Prior to the final exam, the students were expected to reach a level of 5 on all of the topics. The students also completed homework assignments, a midterm, and a final, which were all scored on a scale from 0 to 100 points. Based on their performance in the class, the students received overall scores that would form the basis of their grades. After the completion of the class, the university wanted to study the performance of the students and the impact of the digital system. To incorporate prior levels of knowledge, the university gathered data about the performance of these students in their mathematics curriculum of trigonometry and calculus.

The data were recorded in the following files:

 - Prior Knowledge: ../Data/Prior Courses.csv
 
 - Digital System, Prior to the Midterm Examination: ../Data/Knowledge Check – Level 2.csv
 
 - Digital System, Prior to the Final Examination: ../Data/Knowledge Check – Level 5.csv
 
 - Scores on the Homework, Exams, and Overall: ../Data/Grades.csv
 
 - Delimiter: Each column of each file is separated with a comma , delimiter.

All of the data files include an identifier column Student ID so that the information from different files can be linked. These identifiers also link to the names of the student and other private information about them, which have been separately stored in a secure location.

In some places, the data may contain unusual values. Any value that does not match up with reasonable expectations for the measure should be converted to a missing value for the purpose of the analysis.
